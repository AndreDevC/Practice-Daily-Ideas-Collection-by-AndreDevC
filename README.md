# :ledger: App Ideas Collection

Embark on a coding journey with me, a haven where creativity meets skill enhancement! Ever faced the dilemma of choosing the next coding project? Similar to writers encountering 'writers block,' developers experience moments of uncertainty. This curated collection aims to banish that uncertainty and provide you with a roadmap for your daily coding endeavors. üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

These applications are:

:star-icon: Ideal for honing your coding prowess and enhancing your skills :muscle:;
‚ú® Perfect for exploring cutting-edge technologies and staying ahead of the curve üÜï;
‚ú® Tailored for enriching your portfolio, leaving a lasting impression on future employers or clients :file_folder:;
‚ú® Suited for crafting engaging tutorials, whether in articles or videos :page_with_curl:;
‚ú® Designed for ease of completion and effortless expansion with additional features :ok_hand:;

This is not just a simple list of projects, but a collection that describes each project in enough detail so that you can develop it from the ground up!

Each project has the following **features**:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. A list of _User Stories_ which should be implemented (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of _To-Do's_. Feel free to add your own stories if you want);
3. A list of bonus features that not only improve the base project, but also your skills at the same time (these are optional and should be attempted only after you have completed the required user stories)
4. All the resources and links to help you find what you need to complete the project

## Projects

Projects are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience
required to complete them.

| Tier | Developer Profile                                                                                                                                                |
| :--: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | Developers in the early stages of their learning journey. Those who are typically focused on creating user-facing applications.                                  |
|  2   | Developers at an intermediate stage of learning and experience. They are comfortable in UI/UX, using development tools, and building apps that use API services. |
|  3   | Developers who have all of the above, and are learning more advanced techniques like implementing backend applications and database services.                    |
